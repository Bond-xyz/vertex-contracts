# Bond PerpDex Galileo Contract Release

This branch starts at audited Vertex V2 commit `6d5df597afe4eb16c6131a85f45322e0954b9e94` and is a **fresh-deploy-only** release. It never upgrades or adopts the existing Fable proxies.

## Explicit source deltas

1. Restore the `Version.sol` implementation omitted by the published audited snapshot so the source compiles.
2. Re-enable `OffchainExchange` EIP-712 order-signature enforcement.
3. Emit `DepositCollateralWithReferral`, which Bond settlement indexes for deposit provenance.
4. Deploy one non-custodial `VirtualBook` marker per product to prevent cross-market signature replay.

The proxy deployment explicitly permits the audited `Clearinghouse` delegatecall to the pinned `ClearinghouseLiq` implementation; no other unsafe OpenZeppelin validation bypass is allowed.

No unsigned batch overload and no `UpdatePerpBalance` transaction exist.

## Release gate

```bash
HUSKY=0 corepack yarn install --frozen-lockfile --ignore-engines
corepack yarn force-compile
corepack yarn test:release
```

Generate three independent Galileo-only verifier keys without printing them:

```bash
corepack yarn keys:galileo
```

The deployment remains fail-closed until `config/galileo.products.json` is explicitly approved after Rust/contract X18 golden-vector review.

## Fresh deployment command

Use the existing ignored backend env file without copying or printing it:

```bash
export PERPDEX_ENV_FILE=/Users/blackbera/Desktop/Bond/perpdex-rust-backend/contracts/core/.env.galileo.local
export PERPDEX_VERIFIER_PUBLIC_KEYS_FILE=./config/galileo.verifier-public-keys.local.json
export PERPDEX_PRODUCTS_FILE=./config/galileo.products.json
export PERPDEX_DEPLOYMENT_MANIFEST=./deployments/16602/latest.local.json
corepack yarn deploy:galileo
corepack yarn verify:galileo
```

Required post-deploy integrations are deliberately outside this contract cartridge: Rust batch Schnorr signing, wallet order/withdrawal signature persistence, X9/X8-to-X18 conversion, audited-array `PerpTick` encoding, and removal of type 33.
